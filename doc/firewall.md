# configuring the firewall

## source ranges

When configuring firewall rules, it's important to restrict access to only the necessary IP ranges to enhance security. Allowing access from 0.0.0.0/0 (anywhere) is generally not recommended unless absolutely necessary. Here are some best practices for determining a good applicable source range when working with Google Cloud Provider:

Best Practices for Determining Source Ranges:
1.Identify Trusted IP Ranges:

Determine the specific IP addresses or ranges that need access. This could be your office's public IP address, the IP addresses of your remote workers, or the IP ranges of other trusted services.

2.Use VPC Peering or VPN:

If you have multiple networks that need to communicate securely, consider using VPC peering or a VPN. This way, you can restrict access to internal IP ranges only.

3.Use Private Google Access:

For services that need to access Google APIs and services, use Private Google Access to keep traffic within Google's network.

4.Regularly Review and Update:

Regularly review your firewall rules and update the source ranges as needed. Remove any IP ranges that are no longer required.


Example of Restricting Source Ranges:
Assuming you have identified the trusted IP ranges, you can specify them in your terraform.tfvars file:

```tf_firewall_info = {
  name          = "allow-ssh"
  source_tags   = ["web"]
  source_ranges = ["203.0.113.0/24", "198.51.100.0/24"]  # Replace with your trusted IP ranges
  target_tags   = ["ssh"]
}```


Example google_compute_firewall Resource:
```resource "google_compute_firewall" "allow-ssh" {
  name    = var.tf_firewall_info.name
  network = google_compute_network.terraform_network.name

  allow {
    protocol = "icmp"
  }

  allow {
    protocol = "tcp"
    ports    = ["22"]
  }

  source_tags   = var.tf_firewall_info.source_tags
  source_ranges = var.tf_firewall_info.source_ranges
  target_tags   = var.tf_firewall_info.target_tags
}```

Summary:
Identify and use trusted IP ranges: Only allow access from known and trusted IP addresses.
Use VPC peering or VPN: For secure internal communication.
Regularly review firewall rules: Ensure they are up-to-date and only include necessary IP ranges.
