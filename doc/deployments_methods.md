Sure, let's go through the various deployment strategies, their use cases, and their pros and cons.

### 1. **Blue/Green Deployment**
**Description**: 
- Two identical environments (blue and green) are maintained. One (blue) is the live environment, while the other (green) is used for the new version.
- Once the new version is tested and verified in the green environment, traffic is switched from blue to green.

**Use Cases**:
- When you need zero downtime during deployment.
- When you want a quick rollback option.

**Pros**:
- Zero downtime.
- Easy rollback by switching traffic back to the blue environment.
- Reduced risk as the new version is fully tested before going live.

**Cons**:
- Requires double the infrastructure, which can be costly.
- Complexity in maintaining two environments.

### 2. **Canary Deployment**
**Description**:
- The new version is gradually rolled out to a small subset of users (canary) before being rolled out to the entire user base.
- Monitoring and feedback from the canary users help identify issues before a full rollout.

**Use Cases**:
- When you want to minimize the risk of deploying new features.
- When you need to gather user feedback on new features.

**Pros**:
- Reduced risk as issues can be identified early.
- Allows for real-world testing with a small user base.
- Gradual rollout makes it easier to manage and monitor.

**Cons**:
- Requires careful monitoring and management.
- Potentially complex to implement and automate.
- Users in the canary group may experience issues.

### 3. **Rolling Deployment**
**Description**:
- Gradually replace instances of the old version with instances of the new version.
- The deployment is done in phases, with a few instances updated at a time.

**Use Cases**:
- When you need to update a large number of instances without downtime.
- When you want to minimize the impact on users.

**Pros**:
- Minimal downtime as the deployment is gradual.
- Easier to manage and monitor compared to a full deployment.
- Can be automated with deployment tools.

**Cons**:
- Rollback can be complex if issues are found.
- Requires careful planning to ensure a smooth transition.
- Users may experience inconsistent behavior during the deployment.

### 4. **A/B Testing**
**Description**:
- Two versions (A and B) are deployed simultaneously to different segments of users.
- Performance and user experience are compared to determine the better version.

**Use Cases**:
- When you want to test new features or changes with real users.
- When you need to make data-driven decisions based on user behavior.

**Pros**:
- Provides valuable insights into user preferences and behavior.
- Allows for data-driven decision-making.
- Can be used to test multiple variations simultaneously.

**Cons**:
- Requires careful planning and segmentation of users.
- Users may experience different versions, leading to inconsistency.
- Can be complex to implement and analyze.

### 5. **Recreate Deployment**
**Description**:
- The old version is completely shut down before the new version is started.
- This approach involves downtime during the deployment.

**Use Cases**:
- When downtime is acceptable or can be scheduled during off-peak hours.
- When the deployment process is simple and quick.

**Pros**:
- Simple to implement and manage.
- No need to maintain multiple environments.

**Cons**:
- Involves downtime, which can impact users.
- No quick rollback option if issues are found.
- Not suitable for high-availability applications.

### 6. **Shadow Deployment**
**Description**:
- The new version is deployed alongside the old version but does not serve live traffic.
- The new version processes the same requests in the background for testing purposes.

**Use Cases**:
- When you want to test the new version with real-world traffic without impacting users.
- When you need to validate the new version's performance and behavior.

**Pros**:
- Allows for thorough testing with real-world traffic.
- No impact on users as the new version does not serve live traffic.
- Issues can be identified and fixed before going live.

**Cons**:
- Requires additional infrastructure to run both versions simultaneously.
- Complexity in routing traffic to both versions.
- No immediate user feedback as the new version is not live.

### 7. **Feature Toggles (Feature Flags)**
**Description**:
- New features are deployed in the codebase but hidden behind feature toggles.
- Features can be enabled or disabled for different user segments.

**Use Cases**:
- When you want to deploy new features gradually.
- When you need to test features with specific user groups.

**Pros**:
- Allows for gradual rollout and testing of new features.
- Features can be quickly enabled or disabled based on feedback.
- Reduces the risk of deploying new features.

**Cons**:
- Requires careful management of feature toggles.
- Can lead to complex codebase with multiple toggles.
- Potential performance impact if not managed properly.

### 8. **Immutable Deployment**
**Description**:
- New instances with the new version are deployed without modifying the existing instances.
- Once the new instances are verified, traffic is switched to them.

**Use Cases**:
- When you want to ensure consistency and avoid configuration drift.
- When you need a reliable rollback option.

**Pros**:
- Ensures consistency as new instances are created from scratch.
- Easy rollback by switching traffic back to the old instances.
- Reduces the risk of configuration drift.

**Cons**:
- Requires additional infrastructure to run both versions simultaneously.
- Can be complex to manage and automate.
- Potentially higher cost due to maintaining multiple instances.

Each deployment strategy has its own advantages and trade-offs. The choice of strategy depends on factors such as the application's architecture, the team's familiarity with the strategy, the acceptable level of risk and downtime, and the specific requirements of the deployment.
