GCP: can we chose different "availability zones" for different VMs ? (like Azure)
with several VMs :  if there's a failure on-site, our website needs to still be available while GCP repairs affected VM
also, having several VMs help with future CI/CD



firewall : source ranges
having : ```source_ranges = ["0.0.0.0/0"]``` allows access from anywhere
 -> need to change that for the better
